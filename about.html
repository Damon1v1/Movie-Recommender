                  <p>I'm a student at UCI bootcamp. My dream job is to become a web developer at Facebook. Why Facebook? well I have an account on Facebook for almost 12 years now. https://www.facebook.com/NourTarekSaad. I get all my news and connections from Facebook. I believe the idea of Facebook when it first started was amazing. How could someone think about making a website that connects people by click of a button. There is so much still to be done to that website. <!---- Added my own description-->

                    I didn't really like the text provided so I decided to add a couple of fun facts about myself. I was born in Mexico, and moved to the U.S. When I was 6. I was raised between LA and Big Bear, CA. This Year I became a U.S. Citizen so that was pretty dope.<!--- Added my own description-->

                    I'm not at all a fan of this year overall, hoever. It's been pretty lame since March. Well I think that's it. Kudos on getting through this nonsense text. <!---- Added my own description-->
